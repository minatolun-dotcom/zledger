## Completed Phase 20 Work
- **Advanced voucher features**:
  - Voucher list in DayBook uses popup modal (Edit/Duplicate/Delete) — done
  - Voucher page also uses the same popup modal (merged pattern) — done
  - Duplicate (POST) auto-closes modal after save — done
  - Update (PATCH) keeps modal open with refreshed data — done
  - All 3 forms (ItemVoucherForm, AmountVoucherForm, JournalForm) call `resetForm()` after successful creation — done
  - Counter ledger validation in ItemVoucherForm — done
  - Multi-item "Duplicate ledger in lines" bug fixed (item lines without stock_item_id now correctly handled) — done
- **Select component migration**: Replaced native `<select>` with custom `Select` component in MembersPage, GstSettingsPage, AuditLogPage, AdminUsersPage — all selects now use the themed dropdown with dark mode support
- **Phase 20: Reports Suite**:
  - Cash Flow Statement (direct method): operating/investing/financing categories, opening/closing cash balance, net increase
  - Aging Analysis: receivables/payables toggle, 0-30/31-60/61-90/90+ day buckets per party
  - Outstanding Report: party-wise debtor/creditor balances with totals
  - Register Report: daybook filtered by voucher type (8 types supported)
  - All 4 reports integrated into ReportsPage tabs with proper frontend rendering
- **Phase 21: TDS/TCS Summary + Inventory Reports**:
  - TDS/TCS Summary Report: party-wise breakdown by section, TDS/TCS toggle, status counts (pending/deposited/filed), total base amount and tax
  - Stock Summary Report: current balance per item with quantity, avg rate, total value, valuation method
  - Stock Movement Report: opening/inward/outward/closing qty and value per item
  - Stock Ageing Report: days since last entry, colour-coded ageing buckets (0-30/31-60/61-90/90+ days)
  - All 4 reports added to ReportsPage as new tabs with full dark mode support
  - Backend: `get_tds_tcs_party_summary()` service, `get_stock_ageing_report()` service, 4 new API endpoints, 6 new response schemas
- **Masters & COA UI Improvements**:
  - MastersPage: Improved empty states with icons, descriptive text, and action buttons
  - MastersPage: System ledgers/groups indicated with lock icon instead of SYS badge
  - MastersPage: Context menu (⋮) on groups with Edit, Create Ledger, Create Subgroup, Delete actions
  - ChartOfAccountsPage: Fixed TypeScript error (removed redundant type comparison)
  - Shared `ContextMenu` component extracted with viewport bounds checking (prevents overflow off-screen)
  - Calendar component switched to `position: fixed` with viewport bounds checking (prevents overflow off-screen)
  - DayBookPage: Replaced native `<input type="date">` with themed `DateInput` component
  - Shared `GroupForm` and `LedgerForm` modal components (centered popup with overlay)
  - ChartOfAccountsPage: Context menu (⋮ + right-click) wired to open modal forms for Edit, Create Ledger, Create Subgroup, Delete
  - MastersPage: Migrated from inline forms to shared modal form components
  - **Masters merged into COA**: Active/inactive status badges on ledger nodes, group filter dropdown, "+ New" button. Masters route/link removed from sidebar and dashboard.
- **Inventory Popup Modals**: Stock Groups, Stock Items, and Stock Entries all use clickable rows/cards that open centered popup modals (edit/delete/duplicate/save). Action buttons removed from all three tabs. Button shows "Update" when editing, auto-closes on success.

## Demo Data

- **5 parties**: 3 customers (incl. 1 inter-state Gujarat), 2 suppliers (incl. 1 inter-state Karnataka)

### FY Management: Update & Delete Endpoints
- **PATCH /coa/financial-years/{id}**: Update name/start_date/end_date via `FinancialYearUpdate` schema. Returns 400 if overlapping dates.
- **DELETE /coa/financial-years/{id}**: Deletes FY only if no vouchers exist. Returns 400 with voucher count if blocked.
- **Frontend FY Management page** (`frontend/src/pages/FinancialYearsPage.tsx`): Full CRUD table with create/edit forms (auto-fills end_date/name from start_date), delete with confirm, close/reopen toggle. Route at `/financial-years`, linked in sidebar.

### FY Management Enhancements
- **FY overlap validation**: `POST /coa/financial-years` now rejects date ranges overlapping existing FYs
- **FY close/unclose**: `PATCH /coa/financial-years/{id}/close` — toggles `is_closed`. When closing, automatically creates opening balance journal for the next FY (carries forward balance sheet ledgers via Opening Balance Equity)
- **FY closed guard**: Voucher creation (`POST /vouchers`) and update (`PATCH /vouchers/{id}`) blocked if date falls in a closed FY
- **Dashboard FY filter**: Recent vouchers now scoped to the selected FY's date range

## Navigation Redesign (Accounting-Focused)
- **Sidebar reorganized**: Accounting-only modules (Masters, Transactions, Reports, Compliance) with collapsible groups. Masters includes Chart of Accounts, Inventory, and nested Company submenu (Company Settings, Financial Years).
- **Profile dropdown**: Admin/settings items (Members, Audit Log, Settings) moved to user avatar popover at sidebar bottom. Superadmin gets Users/Companies in profile menu.
- **Company card redesigned**: Clean layout showing company name, GSTIN (fetched from API), and inline FY selector. Gradient background for visual separation.
- **Global search placeholder** at sidebar top (Ctrl+K / `/` shortcut hint).
- **Visual hierarchy improved**: Better spacing, typography, active/hover states, indented sub-items with left border, disabled "Banking" (future) and "Preferences" (soon) items with badges.
- All existing routes preserved; no functionality broken.

## Dark Mode (Complete — Premium Redesign)
- **Infrastructure**: `darkMode: 'class'` in tailwind.config.js, flash-prevention script in index.html, theme store (`store/theme.ts`) with localStorage persistence.
- **Premium palette**: Layered surfaces — Page `#0a0a0f`, Sidebar `#111118`, Cards `#18181f`, Hover `#1e1e28`, Elevated `#252530`. Violet-500 accent for active nav, focus states, important actions.
- **Typography hierarchy**: Primary `#f1f5f9`, Secondary `#cbd5e1`, Muted `#64748b`. Font sizes: 15px brand, 13px nav/items, 11px metadata.
- **Shadows**: Custom dark shadow scale (`shadow-dark-sm` through `shadow-dark-xl`) with realistic depth.
- **Scrollbars**: Refined dark scrollbars matching the palette.
- **CSS variables**: `--surface-0` through `--surface-4`, `--border-subtle`/`--border-default`, `--text-primary`/`--text-secondary`/`--text-muted`, `--accent`.
- **Toggle**: Dark/Light mode toggle in profile dropdown (sidebar bottom). Respects system preference on first visit.
- **Sidebar**: Premium dark sidebar with gradient brand icon, layered company card, violet accent on active nav, refined hover states.
- **All 30+ pages** updated with premium dark palette: auth, dashboard, masters, vouchers, reports, compliance, admin/settings.
- All existing light mode classes preserved; dark variants added alongside.
- **Global dark input fix**: CSS rules for `dark input`, `dark select`, `dark textarea` ensure all form elements get dark backgrounds, borders, text, and focus styles. `color-scheme: dark` on `html.dark` for native browser UI (date pickers, scrollbars).
